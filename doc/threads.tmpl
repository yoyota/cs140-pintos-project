1 struct timer {
   2     int64_t expires;
   3     struct thread *thread;
   4     struct list_elem elem;
   5 };

   * Purpose: Represents a sleeping thread, storing its wake-up time (expires) and a pointer to the thread itself for waking it up.

  File: `devices/timer.c`



   1 static int64_t ticks;

   * Purpose: A global counter for the number of timer interrupts since the OS booted, used to measure time.



   1 static struct list timer_list;

   * Purpose: A global list containing struct timer elements for all threads that are currently sleeping via timer_sleep().


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

1. The calling thread disables interrupts, creates a timer structure containing its desired wake-up time, and adds it to a global
    list of sleeping threads.
2. The thread then blocks, yielding the CPU.
3. The periodic timer interrupt handler checks the list of sleeping threads. When a thread's wake-up time arrives, the handler
    unblocks it.
4. Once unblocked, the thread becomes ready to run and will eventually be scheduled to resume execution right after its call to
    timer_sleep().

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

Here's the sequence of events and why a race condition is
  avoided:

1. A thread enters the timer_sleep() function.
2. It immediately calls enum intr_level old_level = intr_disable();. At this exact moment, all interrupts, including timer
    interrupts, are turned off for the current CPU core.
3. The code then proceeds to create a timer and add it to the timer_list.
4. Finally, it calls thread_block().


Because interrupts are disabled, a timer interrupt cannot occur between the call to intr_disable() and the point where the thread
blocks and the scheduler is invoked. The operations on the shared timer_list are performed within a critical section protected by
the interrupt disable/enable mechanism.


If a hardware timer interrupt signal arrives while interrupts are disabled, the CPU's interrupt controller will hold it in a
pending state. The interrupt will only be serviced after the current thread blocks and the scheduler switches to a new thread,
which will eventually re-enable interrupts as part of its normal operation. By that time, the sleeping thread's timer is already
safely on the timer_list, so there is no race condition.



>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

Disable Interrupts: The most crucial step is the call to intr_disable() in timer_sleep(). This is done after the timer has been
added to the sleep queue but before the thread is put to sleep. Disabling interrupts prevents the CPU from responding to any
hardware interrupts, including the timer interrupt.
Atomic Operation: Because interrupts are disabled, the timer_interrupt() handler cannot run between the intr_disable() call and
the thread_block() call. This makes the process of adding a timer, disabling interrupts, and going to sleep an atomic operation
with respect to the interrupt handler.
thread_block(): The thread_block() function, which actually puts the thread to sleep, requires that interrupts are already
disabled. It even includes an ASSERT to enforce this, crashing the kernel if a thread tries to block without first disabling
interrupts.
Scheduler: thread_block() then calls schedule(), which also runs with interrupts disabled. The scheduler chooses the next thread
to run and switches to it. Interrupts will be re-enabled later, either by the new thread's context or when the original thread is
eventually woken up and timer_sleep() calls intr_set_level(old_level).

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
